## devkit
The devkit makefiles together define a build system that extends
the "standard" targets (as documented by GNU make) with a few extras
for performing common maintenance functions.  The basic principles
are:

 * the standard make targets are magically recursive
 * $(LANGUAGE).mk extends standard targets by defining "dependent" actions
 * per-system tool customisations defined in $(OS).mk, $(ARCH).mk
 * all system-specific files are saved in $(archdir) subdirectory
 * file dependencies are auto-included, and auto-generated by build target.
 * traditional macros work as expected (e.g. CFLAGS, LDFLAGS)

This file defines variables according to the conventions described
in the GNU make documentation (c.f. "Makefile Conventions" section).

Note that these directories are not truly faithful to the GNU doc.s,
in particular I avoid the $(archdir) suffix, for most of the
installation directories.  This is more useful in practice.

## valid
The "valid" module is a library of validation tests in the form of
make targets.  These are used by various metarules in the build
system.

## mk
"lang/mk" contains rules for managing makefiles.  These are just
customisations of the standard make targets.

## markdown
The markdown module recognises both "original" markdown files
(".md"), and "multimarkdown" files (".mmd"), defined by MD_SRC and
MMD_SRC respectively. MMD files are assumed to create full
documents, and are created by `build`, using multimarkdown. There
are pattern rules for converting MD src to HTML, but markdown
doesn't create a full HTML document, and they aren't built by
default.


## darwin
The "darwin" module contains customisations for the Darwin OS,
i.e. Mac OS X.  Libraries are a little quirky under darwin, and in
particular, you can't move a library after building it.  ranlib(1)
resets whatever needs to be done, and the build rules will apply it
if defined.

## .mk
The project include file defines overall customisations for existing
rules. This is the "no-project" project, which contains some default
settings to consider as a template.
