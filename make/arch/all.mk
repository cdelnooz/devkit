#
# ALL --definitions for "all" (actually, none) archictectures.
#
# Remarks:
# The debian packaging system needs to identify packages that are
# architecture-independent, and uses the suffix "all" to achieve this.
# So, for such packages, the ARCH macro will be defined as "all", and
# will include this file.
#
# Summary: this file intentionally left blank(!)
